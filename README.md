# Pi in my Gameboy
Raspberry Pi Gameboy Raspbian and RetroPie GUI
*This is a WIP. More details (and photos) coming soon!

#Intro
This is Jason Wozniak and Mariano Montori's HackIllinois project, where we're trying to make a Gameboy out of a Raspberry Pi. The problem that we ran into during the event is that since we have the Raspberry Pi with both Raspbian and RetroPie, we needed an easy interface to run RetroPie. This TkInter based Python GUI is made to simply set up and run RetroPie on top of Raspbian without having to run any scripts, and instead just click a simple button to start it.

#Requirements
###Python 2.7 Dependencies

-TkInter

TkInter already comes installed with Mac or Windows.
